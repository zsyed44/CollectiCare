# **CollectiCare: Offline-First Patient Data Management App**

**THIS BRANCH HAS ALL THE FACIAL RECOGNITION CAPABILITIES, WHICH UNFORTUNATELY WAS NOT DEPLOYABLE**

## **Project Overview**
This project aims to develop an **offline-first mobile application** designed for medical camps across India. The application enables healthcare workers to collect, store, and manage **patient data locally**, ensuring accessibility even in areas with limited or no internet connectivity. Once a connection is available, data will be synchronized with a **centralized database** for long-term storage and analysis.

## **Key Features**
- **Offline Data Storage**: Collect and store patient records locally.
- **Data Synchronization**: Seamlessly sync local data with the central database when online.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login for healthcare workers.
- **Structured Medical Questionnaires**: Standardized forms for patient diagnosis and treatment tracking.
- **Eye Testing**: Various tools in the application to hold on patient eye tests.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Built with Flutter to support both Android and iOS.

## **Tech Stack**
### **Frontend**
- **Flutter** (Dart): Cross-platform framework for mobile development.

### **Backend**
- **SpringBoot & Express**: Handles API requests and business logic.

### **Database**
- **OrientDB**: NoSQL multi-model database for scalable data management.

## **Setup Instructions**
### **Prerequisites**
- Install **Flutter**: [Flutter Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- Install **Node.js** and **npm**: [Node.js Download](https://nodejs.org/)
